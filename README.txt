At the top of every script, please put the following! 

# Author(s): 
# Contributors:  
# Description: 

Authors are the ones who are taking the charge on a particular task/analysis.

Contributors are those who make relatively changes (maybe the authors need help with something or something has to be changed retroactively after the authors are finished).

The description in a short summary of what your script does.



FOR FIGURES:

Towards the end of your filename, include some version of your name so we can keep track of who made that particular version of the figure.

Ex: 'family_site_durant.png'
